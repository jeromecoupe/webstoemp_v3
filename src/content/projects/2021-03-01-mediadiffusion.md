Médiadiffusion hired me to design and develop their public website. The main goal is to showcase students' graduation projects (films, games, VFX, 3D, 2D, etc). A clean grid and a neutral design helps focusing the attention on projects, while a multi-criteria search engine allows you to easily sift through the catalog.
